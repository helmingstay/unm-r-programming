= Abstract = 
The UNM R Programming Group is an informal working group devoted to learning and exploring the R programming language.  Open to anyone interested in scientific computing and data visualization, the group meets weekly to share ideas and experiences with R.  Each semester, the group chooses a focus dataset to explore.

Here we conduct an exploratory data analysis of eBird. eBird is a citizen science bird observation network.  Founded in 2002 by the Cornell Lab of Ornithology and the National Audobon Society, it allows scientists and non-scientists alike to report their bird observations by species, time, and location.  These observations are then pooled into an extensive database of bird abundance and distribution.

Here we focus on eBird Puerto Rico from 2002 to 2011.  We augment this dataset with daily weather records from 8 airports in Puerto Rico.  We examine bird abundance and distribution patterns on the island of Puerto Rico across time and space.  In particular, we ask how different migrant species' abundances change from year to year on Puerto Rico and assess the impact of weather events such as tropical cyclonic events.  We further asses whether migrant shorebirds more likely to show inter-year variation in abundances than migrant songbirds, and the dependence of these differences on weather events.
