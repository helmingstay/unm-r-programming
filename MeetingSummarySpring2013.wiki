= 1 Feb 2013 =
  * No script file for this week
  * Josh found prcomp() for principle component analysis
  * Start looking at sewer data, dependence on air temp
  * Intro to ggplot
  * Discussion of ggplot and aes:
{{{
## CORRECT
## use a variable to control an aesthetic
geom_point(aes(color=size))
## If using a constant, don't use aes()
geom_point(color='green')

## WRONG
## works but probably isn't what you want
geom_point(aes(color='green'))
## doesn't make sense
geom_point(color=size)
}}}

  * Different plotting systems in R
    # Base graphics: plot(x,y)
    # Lattice: xyplot(y~x, data)
    # ggplot2: ggplot(data, aes(x=x, y=y)) + geom_point()
    # Both lattice and ggplot are based on the grid package
  * Intro to ggplot with bird mophology dataset
  * Tab-based autocompletion in Rstudio
  * Cool ggplot tricks:  
    # facet_wrap()
    # geom_smooth()

  * Introductions.
  * Mark Holstadt's dataset -- excel vs. R!
  * Intro to data types in R
    # Vectors: atomic mode
    # Lists: arbitrary collection of objects
    # Data.frames: special lists, each list element has same length
