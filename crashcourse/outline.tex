\section*{What is it, and who's it for?}
The R Crash Course is an intensive workshop that focuses on data management and
visualization in R.   It is designed primarily for scientists, and is appropriate
for beginning and intermediate R users.   Using hands-on activities and your own
data, you will learn basic programming, gain experience in common data manipulation
tasks, and create your own publication-quality figures.

\section*{Background}
R is a statistical 
 analysis framework and programming language that is heavily used by
researchers in a wide range of fields.
Effective use of software tools like R can greatly enhance
research productivity and enable communication of results
through high-quality data visualization. New users often find R
challenging, intimidating, or downright confusing. 
The R Crash Course aims to accelerate the steep learning curve 
that many new R users encounter.  

\section*{Requirements}
The most important requirement of this workshop is time and a willingness to
work.  Partipants are expected to attend all sessions and spend 1-2 hours/day
individually on assignments.

Prior experience with R or a spreadsheet program like Excel is helpful but not
required.  Participants should be comfortable with basic
computer use, and must have their own computer.  Prior to the workshop, participants
must install R and Rstudio and select a dataset for workshop use.  Students are
encouraged to work in small groups on a shared dataset.
