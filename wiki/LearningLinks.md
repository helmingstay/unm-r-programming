# R Learning Links
A collection of educational material for R

## Tutorials 
* [R Labs for Community Ecologists](http://ecology.msu.montana.edu/labdsv/R/) is a series of in-depth labs on the vegan package, including good coverage of ordination.

## R News 
* David at Revolutions Analytics does a great job of collecting R news here: http://blog.revolutionanalytics.com/
* [R Bloggers](http://www.r-bloggers.com/) is perhaps the go-to community R blog
* [ The R Journal](http://journal.r-project.org/) is a peer-reviewed journal with articles about packages, as well as general R news and tutorials.

## Graphing and Document Preparation
* [Overview of Lattice](http://science.nature.nps.gov/im/datamgmt/statistics/r/advanced/latticegraphics.cfm)
* [ggplot2 docs](http://docs.ggplot2.org/current/)
* [ R Graph Gallery](http://rgraphgallery.blogspot.com/)
* [ R Graphical Manual](http://rgm3.lab.nig.ac.jp/RGM/R_image_list?navi_idx=0)
* The [animation package](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/animation/index.html) helps make movies in many formats
* [knitr](http://yihui.name/knitr/) is the go-to package for literate programming / manuscript preparation
* Webapps with R?  Try [shiny](http://shiny.rstudio.com/).  I've heard good things about it.

## R Package Documentation 
* [Crantastic](http://crantastic.org/): search for R packages by topic.  Shows development activity and reviews.  
* CRAN provides a [full list of R packages in one page](http://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/available_packages_by_name.html).  You can use web browser to for keywords.
* CRAN also provides a [list of task views](https://cran.r-project.org/web/views/): one page per topic, listing key R packages. 

## R Core Documentation  
* [R FAQs](http://cran.r-project.org/faqs.html), including OSX and Windows. Check these if you have problems with installation, etc.
* [The core R manuals](http://cran.r-project.org/manuals.html) are the sacred texts and ultimate authority of R.  They can answer obscure questions. The data import/export manual is short and sweet.

## Miscellaneous

### R Studio  
* If you like GUIs, you probably want to use R Studio.
* Here's great list of [R Studio keyboard shortcuts](http://rstudio.org/docs/using/keyboard_shortcuts).

### Coming from Matlab? Working with Matlab?
* [The definitive reference](http://www.math.umaine.edu/~hiebeler/comp/matlabR.html) on translating from R to Matlab, and vise versa.
* A detailed comparison of differences, available free to UNM patrons: http://www.springerlink.com/content/g0673qq11172u44j/
